#1. Import the NUMPY package under the name np.

import numpy as np

#2. Print the NUMPY version and the configuration.

print(np.version.version)
np.show_config()

#3. Generate a 2x3x5 3-dimensional array with random values. Assign the array to variable "a"
# Challenge: there are at least three easy ways that use numpy to generate random arrays. How many ways can you find?

a = np.random.random((2, 3, 5))

#4. Print a.

print(a)

#5. Create a 5x2x3 3-dimensional array with all values equaling 1.
#Assign the array to variable "b"

b = np.ones((5, 2, 3))

#6. Print b.

print(b)

#7. Do a and b have the same size? How do you prove that in Python code?

print(a.size == b.size)
# compare sizes

#8. Are you able to add a and b? Why or why not?

result = a + b
# No, they're not the same shapes

#9. Transpose b so that it has the same structure of a (i.e. become a 2x3x5 array). Assign the transposed array to varialbe "c".

c = b.transpose(1, 2, 0)

#10. Try to add a and c. Now it should work. Assign the sum to varialbe "d". But why does it work now?

d = a + c
# Now they have the same shapes.

#11. Print a and d. Notice the difference and relation of the two array in terms of the values? Explain.

print("Array a:\n", a)
print("Array d:\n", d)
# Since c consists of ones, d = a+1

#12. Multiply a and c. Assign the result to e.

e = a * c

#13. Does e equal to a? Why or why not?

print(np.array_equal(e, a))
# Yes, multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value.

#14. Identify the max, min, and mean values in d. Assign those values to variables "d_max", "d_min", and "d_mean"

d_max = d.max()
d_min = d.min()
d_mean = d.mean()

#15. Now we want to label the values in d. First create an empty array "f" with the same shape (i.e. 2x3x5) as d using `np.empty`.

f = np.empty(d.shape)

"""
#16. Populate the values in f. For each value in d, if it's larger than d_min but smaller than d_mean, assign 25 to the corresponding value in f.
If a value in d is larger than d_mean but smaller than d_max, assign 75 to the corresponding value in f.
If a value equals to d_mean, assign 50 to the corresponding value in f.
Assign 0 to the corresponding value(s) in f for d_min in d.
Assign 100 to the corresponding value(s) in f for d_max in d.
In the end, f should have only the following values: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100.
Note: you don't have to use Numpy in this question.

("A", "B", "C", "D", and "E") to label the array elements? You are expecting the result to be:
